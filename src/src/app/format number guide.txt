**** ONLY IN CURRENCY*****



now in ts mainly in pdf we need to call the function to change the number format 
we  need to import formatNumber() // this function takes number to convert and type of format 'american'|'indian'  by default it is 'american' so no need to pass any argument
`${this.currency_type.symbol} ${formatNumber(data['subtotal_other_before_tax'])}`


for now we need to use in all the pdf start from job module and income module
